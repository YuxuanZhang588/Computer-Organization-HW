## Computer Organization (CSC250, Spring 2022) - Homework Assignments
This repository contains all of my homework assignments from the Computer Organization class. Each assignment focuses on a different aspect of computer architecture and organization, covering topics such as assembly programming, binary arithmetic, and CPU design. Below is a breakdown of each homework included in this repository:
- HW1 Assembler:
  This assignment covers the basics of assembly language, focusing on translating basic assembly instructions into machine code.
- HW2 Binary:
  In this homework, I explored binary arithmetic, including operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication at the binary level. It also covers signed and unsigned numbers in binary format.
- HW3 ALU:
  This assignment involves designing a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that can perform operations like addition, subtraction, and bitwise logic.
- HW4 CPU:
  This homework focuses on simulating the control unit of a basic CPU, including instruction fetching, decoding, and execution.
- HW5 IA32:
  This task involved working with the IA32 (x86) instruction set architecture, focusing on writing assembly programs and understanding low-level operations.
- HW6 Schelling:
  This assignment is based on the Schelling Model of Segregation, where I implemented the model using low-level programming techniques to simulate the phenomenon.
- HW7 Strings:
  In this homework, I worked on string manipulation at a low level, including implementing functions for string comparison, concatenation, and more in assembly language.
- HW8 Shell:
  The final homework involves writing a basic shell program that can execute commands, handle input/output redirection, and manage processes
